question: |
  Congratulations! You have passed the Means Test.
subquestion: |  
  Next, you will be given an appointment for **Statement Taking**. During the Statement Taking, a Legal Executive will ask you questions about your case. You should provide LAB with the full facts of your case as well as all the relevant documents/evidence. This helps LAB to investigate your case and assess whether legal aid should be granted to you.
  
  After your statement is taken, LAB will investigate your case and assess if legal aid should be granted to you. LAB will assess if you have reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a case in Court (“**the Merits Test**”), after we get a thorough understanding of your case.
  
  More information on the Merits Test can be found [here](https://lab.mlaw.gov.sg/legal-services/taking-the-merits-test/).
